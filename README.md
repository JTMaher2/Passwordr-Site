# Passwordr-Site
A cloud-based password manager

This website is a free, secure, cloud-based password manager. It uses the Web Cryptography API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) to encrypt passwords before they are sent to the server. All passwords are stored in Cloud Firestore (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/). Sign-in is handled with Firebase Authentication (https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/). Currently, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub signin are supported.
While I believe this site is secure, I take no liability for damage to your online identity, such as hacked accounts, if you use this site. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
